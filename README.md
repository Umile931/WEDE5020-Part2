## Design Choices
- Colour Palette: #3e2723 (dark brown), #4e342e (medium brown), #fdf6ec (cream background), #6d4c41 (hover), #bcaaa4 (border)
- Typography: Arial/Helvetica for body, Georgia serif for headings to give warm rustic coffee feel
- Layout: Mobile-first approach

## CSS Functionality Implemented
1. CSS Reset: * { margin:0; padding:0; box-sizing:border-box; }
2. Typography styling for h1, h2, p, body line-height
3. Flexbox navigation: nav { display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; }
4. Form styling: inputs, textarea, button with full width and padding
5. Focus states: outline 2px solid #ffab40 for accessibility on all interactive elements
6. Desktop grid: main { display:grid; grid-template-columns:1fr; } with sections containing heading + paragraph together (fixed issue)
7. Two breakpoints:
- @media (min-width:480px) - 2 columns
- @media (min-width:768px) - 3 columns, content stacks cleanly
8. Responsive images: img { max-width:100%; } + srcset implementation on homepage
9. Hover states on nav and buttons

## Responsive Design
- Meta viewport tag included on ALL pages: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
- Images use srcset for different screen sizes
